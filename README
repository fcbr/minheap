This project contains several heap data structures with priority queue
and melding functionality. The heaps is hard-wired to min-heap only
functionality on fixnum keys as I needed maximum performance for this
use case. Since the key comparison is in general limited to one or two
places for every data structure variant only, an extension/re-use for
max-heap functionality should be trivial.


Implemented heap data structures an their properties are collected in
the table below.

Executive summary: for almost all cases the 'pairing heap' should give
                   you the best performance. (or the 'ranked pairing
                   heap' once it is fully debugged and added to the
                   official repo; watch me forgetting to update this
                   note then.)

TODO, add properties table
